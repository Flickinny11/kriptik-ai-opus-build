# If you're reading this, the Vercel-GitHub integration has been having issues
# detecting changes in the server/ subdirectory of this monorepo.
#
# Trigger reason: Fixed TypeScript schema mismatches in Modal API endpoints
# - api/orchestrate.ts: Changed non-existent fields (intentId, metadata, error) to use correct schema (plan, artifacts)
# - api/modal-webhook.ts: Changed metadata/error fields to artifacts
