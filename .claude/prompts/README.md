# Kriptik AI Implementation Prompts
## For Claude Code Extension in Cursor 2.2

**Created**: December 23, 2025

## CRITICAL: WIRE UP, DON'T RECREATE

These prompts WIRE UP your existing sophisticated systems - they do NOT recreate them.

Kriptik AI already has 13+ sophisticated systems:
- 6-Agent Verification Swarm (5 intelligent modes)
- 4-Level Error Escalation (never gives up)
- Anti-Slop Detector (85 minimum, 7 principles)
- Intent Lock (Sacred Contract)
- LATTICE (parallel cell building)
- Tournament Mode (multi-agent judging)
- Predictive Error Prevention
- Streaming Feedback Channel
- Browser-in-Loop
- Context Sync/Sharing
- Evolution Flywheel (5-layer learning)
- Soft Interrupt System
- Coding Agent Wrapper (memory harness)

**DO NOT** recreate these. **WIRE THEM UP**.

## Session Order

### Part 1: Integration (Wire Up Existing Systems)

| Session | Focus | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **1** | Wire BuildLoop | Connect all 9 systems to BuildLoopOrchestrator |
| **2** | Wire Feature Agent | Feature Agents use full 6-phase pipeline |
| **3** | Wire Verification | Continuous verification during builds |
| **4** | Wire Done Contract | Unbypassable Phase 5 Intent Satisfaction |
| **5** | Wire Browser Demo | Phase 6 demonstrates working app |

### Part 2: New Features (Cursor 2.2 Parity + Beyond)

| Session | Focus | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **6** | Visual Editor | Cursor 2.2 parity + AI Element Redesign |
| **7** | AI Element Redesign | Complete image→verify→code pipeline |
| **8** | Debug Mode | Hypothesis-based debugging with runtime logs |

## How to Use

1. Open Cursor 2.2 with Claude Code Extension
2. Run Sessions 1-5 first (integration)
3. Then run Sessions 6-8 (new features)
4. For each session:
   - Open the session file
   - Copy content inside the ``` block under "PROMPT"
   - Paste into Claude Code chat
   - Let Claude implement
   - Verify checklist items
   - Commit with provided message

## The Goal

After completing all sessions:

**Builder View / Feature Agent Flow:**
1. User enters NLP
2. Intent Lock creates Sacred Contract
3. LATTICE builds in parallel
4. Verification Swarm runs continuously
5. Streaming Feedback goes to agents
6. Phase 5 verifies ALL criteria (UNBYPASSABLE)
7. Phase 6 demos working app
8. User clicks "Take Control"

**Visual Editor Flow:**
1. User clicks element in live preview
2. User enters NLP like "make it 3D"
3. FLUX.2 Pro generates image
4. GPT-4o verifies image
5. Claude Opus 4.5 converts to code
6. Sandbox shows element preview
7. "Use It" merges to main app

**Debug Mode Flow:**
1. User describes bug
2. Opus 4.5 generates hypotheses
3. Code instrumented with logs
4. User reproduces bug
5. Logs analyzed
6. Minimal fix generated
7. Instrumentation cleaned up

**This makes Kriptik AI MILES AHEAD of Cursor 2.2 and all competitors.**
