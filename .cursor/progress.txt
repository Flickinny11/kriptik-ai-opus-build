- server/src/seed-ultimate-builder.ts (seed data)

NEW TABLES ADDED:
1. build_intents - Immutable Intent Lock contracts (Phase 0)
2. feature_progress - Feature tracking with passes: true/false
3. verification_results - 6-agent verification swarm results
4. build_checkpoints - Time Machine snapshots
5. app_soul_templates - Design systems for 8 app types
6. error_escalation_history - 4-level error escalation tracking
7. build_mode_configs - Speed Dial (Lightning/Standard/Tournament/Production)
8. tournament_runs - Competing implementations with AI judge
9. intelligence_dial_configs - Per-request capability toggles
10. build_session_progress - Real-time progress for UI streaming

SEED DATA:
- 8 App Soul Templates (immersive_media, professional, developer, creative, social, ecommerce, utility, gaming)
- 4 Build Mode Configs (Lightning 3min, Standard 15min, Tournament 30min, Production 60min)

INDEXES CREATED:
- 12 performance indexes for query optimization

CURRENT STATE:
- Build: Passing
- Linting: No errors
- Phase 10: COMPLETE ✓
- Ready for Phase 1 implementation

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run migration: npx drizzle-kit push:sqlite
2. Run seed: npx tsx src/seed-ultimate-builder.ts
3. Continue with Phase 2: Model Router Enhancements
4. Implement 6-Phase Build Loop (Phase 3)
5. Implement Verification Swarm (Phase 4)

═══ [2025-12-06 PHASE 1 COMPLETE] ═══
COMPLETED: Core Artifacts Services

FILES CREATED:
- server/src/services/ai/intent-lock.ts (IntentLockEngine)
- server/src/services/ai/feature-list.ts (FeatureListManager)
- server/src/services/ai/artifacts.ts (ArtifactManager)
- server/src/services/ai/index.ts (updated exports)

SERVICES IMPLEMENTED:

1. IntentLockEngine (intent-lock.ts)
   - Creates immutable "DONE" definitions (Sacred Contract)
   - Uses Claude Opus 4.5 with HIGH effort, 64K thinking
   - Detects App Soul from prompt
   - Generates success criteria, user workflows, visual identity
   - Contract is LOCKED and never modified after creation

2. FeatureListManager (feature-list.ts)
   - Generates feature list from Intent Contract
   - Tracks features with passes: true/false
   - Per-feature verification status from all 6 agents
   - Priority-based feature assignment
   - Progress summary and artifact generation

3. ArtifactManager (artifacts.ts)
   - Session log management (claude-progress.txt)
   - Build state tracking
   - Verification history
   - Issue resolutions
   - Checkpoint snapshots and restore

CURRENT STATE:
- Build: Passing
- Linting: No errors
- Phase 1: COMPLETE ✓
- Ready for Phase 2

CONTEXT:
- All schema changes are ADDITIVE (no breaking changes)
- Existing tables untouched
- New tables follow exact same patterns as existing
- Ready for Drizzle migration to Turso

═══ [SESSION ARTIFACTS] ═══
FILES CREATED:
- ULTIMATE_BUILDER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- server/src/schema.ts (10 new tables)

- intent.json
- feature_list.json
- .cursor/progress.txt
- .cursor/memory/build_state.json
- .cursor/memory/issue_resolutions.json
- .cursor/memory/decisions.json

ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
- All changes additive (no breaking changes)
- Feature flags for new capabilities
- Gradual rollout by build mode
- Fallback to existing flow if new flow fails
